Here, we will describe the process of merging together the changes from the work we did in [Building the Microkernel, Part 1 (Creating an Overlay)](Building-the-Microkernel,-Part-1-%28Creating-an-Overlay%29) with the files that we'd like to include in our Microkernel ISO from the Razor-Microkernel project itself (the Razor Microkernel Controller and it's dependencies). The approach well will take here will be to overlay multiple gzipped tarfiles over the top of the filesystem from a 'standard' TCL Core distribution ISO. The resulting directory (containing all of the overlays) will then be used to build a new (Razor Microkernel) ISO.
